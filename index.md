## Hello, world!

Eric Schmid is a mathematical sciences PhD researcher at GCAS College working with [Dr. Fernando Tohmé (advisor)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=butwPD4AAAAJ&hl=en) focusing on categorical and compositional game theory and its applications to economics. Committee members include: [Dr. William Mansky (UIC)](https://mansky.lab.uic.edu/), [Dr. Jonathan Weinberger (Chapman)](https://www.chapman.edu/engineering/about/faculty/program-faculty/jonathan-weinberger.aspx) and [Dr. Rocco Gangle (Endicott)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RnrKWB0AAAAJ&hl=en). A multidisciplinary scholar working at the intersection of mathematics, economics, and computer science, Schmid is completing his MS in Applied Mathematics at DePaul University (expected March 2025). He holds a BA from New York University, where he studied Continental Philosophy and Visual Art with a Minor in Mathematics and has completed formal coursework in Introduction to Microeconomics, as well as Introduction to Python at the University of Chicago. In 2007, he co-authored a paper on the economics of targeted drugs in _Targeted Oncology_ as part of an internship at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. He has co-organized two conferences at the Emily Harvey Foundation on the philosophy of science and logic. In 2024, he published a conversation between logician Dr. Colin McLarty and philosopher of math Dr. Andrei Rodin on Schmid's publishing imprint. In 2022, he published a book of his own writing on the philosophy of math Prolegomenon to a Treatise with Bauer Verlag.

## Description of my forthcoming doctoral work

The proposed research project would combine several cutting-edge areas:
- Development of a compiler pipeline for Bayesian Open Games, targeting Python/PyTorch initially and eventually MLIR/ONNX/CUDA
- Integration with Dr. Jules Hedges' DSL in Haskell for Open Games and the kernel language in Idris
- Exploration of automatic differentiation techniques
- Potential optimization through HVM3 fusion

The ultimate goal is to enable efficient computation of Bayesian Nash Equilibria through automatic differentiation in the dependent optics setting. This work would require expertise in contemporary AI technologies (transformers, GPUs, LLMs) and advanced topics in Haskell and compiler design.
