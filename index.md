## Hello, world!

A multidisciplinary scholar working at the intersection of mathematics, economics, and computer science, Schmid is completing his MS in Applied Mathematics at DePaul University (expected March 2025). He holds a BA from New York University, where he studied Continental Philosophy and Visual Art with a Minor in Mathematics and has completed formal coursework in Introduction to Microeconomics, as well as Introduction to Python at the University of Chicago. In 2007, he co-authored a paper on the economics of targeted drugs in _Targeted Oncology_ as part of an internship at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. He has co-organized two conferences at the Emily Harvey Foundation on the philosophy of science and logic. In 2024, he published a conversation between logician Prof. Colin McLarty and philosopher of math Dr. Andrei Rodin on Schmid's publishing imprint. In 2022, he published a book of his own writing on the philosophy of math Prolegomenon to a Treatise with Bauer Verlag.
