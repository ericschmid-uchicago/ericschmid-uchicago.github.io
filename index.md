## Hello, world!

Eric Schmid is a mathematical sciences PhD researcher at GCAS College working on "sheaves for decentralized control" with [Prof. Fernando Tohmé (advisor)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=butwPD4AAAAJ&hl=en), [Prof. Neil Ghani (Strathclyde)](https://www.strath.ac.uk/staff/ghanineilprof/) and [Dr. Toby St Clere Smithe (Topos Institute)](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=wlJckLgAAAAJ&hl=en). Committee members include: [Prof. William Mansky (UIC)](https://mansky.lab.uic.edu/), [Prof. Jonathan Weinberger (Chapman)](https://www.chapman.edu/engineering/about/faculty/program-faculty/jonathan-weinberger.aspx) and [Dr. Rocco Gangle (Endicott)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RnrKWB0AAAAJ&hl=en). A multidisciplinary scholar working at the intersection of mathematics, economics, and computer science, Schmid is completing his MS in Applied Mathematics at DePaul University (expected March 2025). He holds a BA from New York University, where he studied Continental Philosophy and Visual Art with a Minor in Mathematics and has completed formal coursework in Introduction to Microeconomics, as well as Introduction to Python at the University of Chicago. In 2007, he co-authored a paper on the economics of targeted drugs in _Targeted Oncology_ as part of an internship at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. He has co-organized two conferences at the Emily Harvey Foundation on the philosophy of science and logic. In 2024, he published a conversation between logician Dr. Colin McLarty and philosopher of math Dr. Andrei Rodin on Schmid's publishing imprint. In 2022, he published a book of his own writing on the philosophy of math Prolegomenon to a Treatise with Bauer Verlag.
