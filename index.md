## Hello, world!

Eric Schmid is a PhD researcher in Mathematics and Science at GCAS College Dublin supervised by Prof. Fernando Tohmé and Prof. Rocco Gangle, working on the foundations of math, specifically the categorical (fibrational) semantics between Homotopy Type Theory and Polynomial Functors, as well as applied sheaf theory for a decentralized protocol of multiagent systems. He earned an MS in Applied Mathematics from DePaul University (March 2025). He holds a BA from New York University, where he studied Continental Philosophy and Visual Art with a Minor in Mathematics and has completed formal coursework in Introduction to Microeconomics, as well as Introduction to Python at the University of Chicago. In 2007, he co-authored a paper on the economics of targeted drugs in _Targeted Oncology_ as part of an internship at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. He has co-organized two conferences at the Emily Harvey Foundation on the philosophy of science and logic. (In 2024, he published a conversation between logician Prof. Colin McLarty and philosopher of math Dr. Andrei Rodin on Schmid's publishing imprint. In 2022, he published a book of his own writing on the philosophy of math Prolegomenon to a Treatise with Bauer Verlag.)
