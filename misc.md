## "Language Games", released by Mille Plateaux, 59:29, digital

* Eric Schmid's latest sound art release, "Language Games," is a compelling synthesis of philosophy, mathematics, and computer-generated music that invokes a unique auditory exploration of Ludwig Wittgenstein's philosophical text, Philosophical Investigations. The album incorporates text-to-speech renditions of Wittgenstein's work alongside the sonification of complex mathematical concepts such as homotopic path deformation in Euclidean spaces, with and without singularities.

* The central theme of "Language Games" revolves around the translation of these high-level concepts into auditory experiences, reflecting Wittgenstein’s philosophy where language defines the limits of our world — the idea that understanding comes through linguistic frameworks, or "language games." Here, Schmid turns mathematical language into sound, playing with its interpretative limits much like Wittgenstein played with semantics.

* The use of homotopy type theory (HoTT) in this context can be seen as an extension of Robert Brandom’s logical expressivism, which can be formalized through dependent type theory. Brandom's philosophy, deeply rooted in the pragmatist tradition, argues that meaning arises from use, not from representation. In Brandom's terms, logical vocabularies serve to make explicit the inferential roles that underpin semantic content. Similarly, HoTT enriches this view by structuring types (or propositions) in a way that any computational or logical expression reflects a potential transformation or pathway in its underlying topological space — essentially illustrating how these expressions evolve within their defined parameters.

* The sound art of "Language Games" becomes a meta-commentary not only on Wittgenstein's text but also on Brandom's interpretative framework. By sonifying the deformations in R^n and R with a singularity, Schmid audibly represents the transformations and pathways, making explicit the inferential and expressive roles these mathematical constructs play in a formalization of a semantic space through type-theoretic and by extension, homotopic kernels of "language games." This is akin to Brandom’s expressivism, where the expressivity of logic lies in making these inferential roles explicit, which is reflected in the structural and transformational nature of HoTT.

* Moreover, the choice to introduce a singularity partway through the composition echoes Wittgensteinian themes of the abrupt shifts in understanding that can occur as we play different language games via the conventionality of indexicality and its arbitrariness, underscoring the pragmatic "received wisdom" imparted from Master to Apprentice and its limits a la Borges' Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge. This limitation of language aligns with the mathematical idea in HoTT of encountering a fundamentally different algebraic invariant of a topological space and the limitations of vast spaces such as R^n being completely equivalent to a point (up to homotopy); but when a tiny infinitesimal set (i.e. a single point) is excluded from these n-dimensional spaces, the removal breaks entire/analytic functions because said singular holes fundamentally reconstitute the space homotopically, as would the very aporias of propositional language itself.

* In "Language Games," Eric Schmid not only explores the boundaries between language, music, and mathematics but also offers a rich sonic environment where philosophical and mathematical ideas resonate in harmony and tension. This release invites listeners to engage with these concepts on a sensory level, challenging them to discern the implicit logic and meaning woven through the soundscape, much as one navigates and negotiates meaning within language games themselves.

## "Burhuss Frederic Skinner", released by Mille Plateaux, by Eric Schmid & Alyssa Van Denburg, 20:15, digital

* This album consists of granular synthesis using Van Denburg’s voice. She performs a very short libretto about BF Skinner, which I have algorithmically synthesized into sound particles using the SuperCollider software, modulating her voice over and over again.

## "St. Francis", released by Recital, score by Eric Schmid, produced by Sean McCann, voice by Liv Landry, 43 minutes 11 seconds, vinyl LP

* LP edition of the sold out CD/Pamphlet from 2016. The score by Schmid, reading by Landry, and edited/produced by McCann. Includes a big poster of The St. Francis List.

* Emily Martin and Derek Baron on St. Francis (Feb. 2021):

* "What does it mean to pray? To address someone, to plead for something, to welcome humiliation and failure: Please, let me forget about the China Chalet parties, please let there be no countries and no war, please let me love you. Is prayer iteration, or just repetition: My god, my god, my god, my god… To know spleen you just have to be down to be humiliated. But do we know for sure that we are miserable? How do we know?

* This is how it has to go. We listened to this for the first time together in May 2017, while driving from Chicago to New York along the I-80 in Pennsylvania, stopping at the rest area that I later mistook for the famous picture of American “culture.” We stayed at a hotel and may have ordered a pizza. Content first, then, content again. Went inside and drank wine in relative silence, burping. Recognizing the sacredness in the plot of Friends. A choral melisma representative of holy Joy.

* The dreams of moving through a convoluted space of passages, staircases, open courtyards, rooms just glimpsed past a door. It doesn’t seem possible that you can get from one place to the next but according to the logic of the dream you do. I think this has to do with how each little unit of ‘content’ happens at a different distance from your ear. The holiness of the periphery. That you can catch a shard of history if you only find the right distance to stand from the painting.

* But prayer is also like the magic language we were talking about — faith that words do something more than just mean — they have the capacity to effect change in the world, and not just in the like, “words change ppl’s minds” kind of way, but in that the words themselves actually have agency. Form: sing-along."
