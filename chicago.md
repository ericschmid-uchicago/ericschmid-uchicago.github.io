# Do not throw pearls to swine
## by Eric Schmid

In Chicago’s underground cultural ecosystem, two contrasting archetypes illustrate a tension between social performance and authenticity. On one end stands the transactional visual artist – a figure embedded in art circles, adept at networking and accumulating social capital, often cultivating performative friendships to advance within the scene. On the opposite end is the noise/techno elitist – a participant in experimental music subcultures who prizes “realness” above all, embracing authenticity in art and demeanor, sometimes to the point of aloofness or exclusion. This essay examines these two poles in Chicago’s cultural underground, arguing that while neither is without fault, the pursuit of authenticity and genuine community – “going where the love is” – offers a more sincere and fulfilling path. Historical parallels, notably the antics of artist Martin Kippenberger in 1980s Cologne, will be drawn to illuminate how authenticity clashes with social performance in underground scenes. Ultimately, attending shows for the music (and one’s own passion) rather than for scene recognition emerges as a preferable ethos, even if the purist approach has its own insufferable quirks.

## The Transactional Visual Artist: Social Capital and Performative Friendship

Within Chicago’s visual art circles, success is often intertwined with social capital – the network of relationships and mutual recognition that can open doors to exhibitions, residencies, and critical attention. Sociologist Pierre Bourdieu famously defined social capital as “the sum of the resources, actual or virtual, that accrue to an individual or a group by virtue of possessing a durable network of more or less institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance and recognition.” In practice, many emerging artists in the city operate as savvy social actors, building friendships and alliances not just for camaraderie but as strategic investments in their careers. Gallery openings, art school critiques, and DIY art shows double as networking salons. The result is a scene where who you know can matter as much as what you create.

Such performative friendship can be observed in the way art students and young artists attend each other’s shows primarily to “be seen,” maintain alliances, and trade opportunities. These relationships are performative in that they often require performing the role of enthusiastic supporter or confidant, regardless of one’s true feelings. The ethos of the transactional artist is relational: art becomes a social currency as much as a creative endeavor. In Chicago – a city with renowned art institutions and a tight-knit gallery network – this phenomenon is palpable. Many art events are populated by clusters of friends-of-friends, each exchange of praise or flattery potentially serving as a currency exchange of favors and future support. The network of social capital thereby sometimes eclipses artistic authenticity. Critics have noted that this dynamic can lead to a fragile sense of identity among artists: one’s standing is continually validated (or invalidated) by others in the scene, necessitating constant performance. A creative “gang” mentality can even form, wherein groups of artists rally around shared connections and mutual promotion.

Historically, the art world has seen similar patterns. In 1980s West Germany, for example, the painter Martin Kippenberger became central to the Cologne art scene, famously surrounding himself with a close-knit clique of artists. Dubbed the “Hetzler Boys” (after gallerist Max Hetzler), this group included figures like Günther Förg, Albert Oehlen, and Georg Herold. They operated almost like an art-world gang, exhibiting together and carousing through the nightlife. Kippenberger – flamboyant and well-connected – acted as an unofficial spokesman and ringleader for the group. Yet even within this camaraderie lay a transactional logic: Kippenberger’s outsized personality and social antics often set the tone for the scene, and inclusion in the clique conferred art-world cachet. He was “often the unofficial spokesman of the group”, illustrating how a strong social operator can dominate a creative network. This Cologne episode demonstrates that what might appear as bohemian fellowship can double as a power structure built on social capital and performance. A performative friendship economy isn’t unique to Chicago – it has long been a feature of art scenes.

The downside of the transactional artist’s approach is an implicit hollowness and precarity. Relationships based on utility can breed cynicism and insecurity. When art communities function primarily as exchanges of social capital, authenticity may suffer. Artists may start tailoring their persona to fit the expectations of the network, effectively wearing a “mask” on the underground stage. In extreme cases, one’s creative output becomes secondary to social maneuvering – the scene eclipses the art. Moreover, these art-world cliques can be insular, unintentionally excluding those who lack the right connections or the appetite for social games. The love in such communities can feel conditional. An artist might ask: if the performances of friendship and enthusiasm stopped, what would remain? This fragility of identity – propped up by constant validation – is one reason many grow disillusioned with purely transactional cultural scenes. It also sets the stage for conflict with those who reject such performativity.

## The Noise/Techno Elitist: Realness and Authenticity

In stark contrast to the art networkers, Chicago’s noise and techno subcultures champion a very different set of values. The typical noise/techno devotee scorns overt networking and scene posturing; instead, they obsess over “realness.” Authenticity in this context means a deep commitment to the music itself – the sound, the craft, the experience – rather than any external markers of status. Chicago has a rich history of underground music authenticity. The city’s musical underground, from the house music legends of the Warehouse to today’s DIY noise shows, has long “encouraged people to find themselves” through sound, emphasizing community built around shared passion. These music-focused communities are, at their best, driven by love of the art form. Members attend late-night techno sets in dimly lit warehouses or experimental noise performances in improvised venues not to hobnob or climb a social ladder, but to lose themselves in an aesthetic experience. Presence and listening are valued over visibility and networking.

The noise/techno elitist takes this ethos of authenticity to an extreme. Often, they cultivate a persona of purism: only the most underground records, the most uncompromising sounds, the most “legitimate” venues (often illegal or off-the-grid) are deemed worthy. This figure can be standoffish, even hostile, to outsiders or casual participants. To the noise/techno purist, there is a clear line between insiders who truly understand the music’s essence and outsiders who are just there for fun or trendiness. Any whiff of artifice or social climbing is anathema. In Chicago’s techno scene, for instance, one might encounter die-hard fans who disdain the more popular clubs in favor of unadvertised loft parties, or noise aficionados who dismiss any band that gains too much mainstream praise as a sell-out. Their obsession with keeping it “real” manifests as a kind of cultural gatekeeping.

Ironically, this quest for authenticity can breed its own form of elitism and insufferability. The noise/techno elitist often prides themselves on their exclusivity and connoisseurship. They might sneer openly at those who don’t share their purist standards, questioning the credibility of anyone perceived as a dilettante. A candid example comes from a self-described techno fan, who confessed: “I have been called a ‘techno snob’ or ‘techno elitist’ far too many times… and have frankly always embraced the label with a sense of pride.” (Confessions of a Techno Elitist - 6AM). This proud “techno snob” admitted to alienating those who don’t share the same musical values and viewing that alienation as a badge of honor. Such attitudes illustrate how the pursuit of authenticity can curdle into exclusionary behavior. The noise/techno crowd’s aloofness can make their events unwelcoming; newcomers or those not steeped in the proper subcultural knowledge might feel intimidated or looked down upon. The insistence on “realness” sometimes veers into a rigid purity test, where any compromise or accessibility is scorned.

Despite these insufferable tendencies, the core strengths of the noise/techno approach lie in genuine passion and individuality. Participants in these subcultures often have a strong, individuated sense of self that does not rely on constant peer approval. A noise musician in Chicago might toil away at harsh experimental soundscapes with no hope of financial reward or widespread acclaim – simply for the love of the craft. Techno DJs in the underground scene often spend countless hours digging for obscure tracks and perfecting their mixing, motivated by a sincere devotion to music rather than by social accolades. In these communities, one’s identity is grounded internally (in taste, skill, and experience) more than externally. This gives the subculture a resilience and authenticity: members are there for the music, first and foremost. The social bonds that form (and they do form) are byproducts of shared love, not a calculated strategy. Indeed, as Time Out noted in a recent profile of Chicago’s music collectives, “these party collectives aren’t just about the music, they’re about community” and forging spaces for genuine connection. The community that arises in the noise and techno scene may be smaller and harder to penetrate, but for those within it, it often feels earnest and hard-earned.

To outsiders, the noise/techno elitist might seem as insufferable as the art scene socialite – just in a different register. But a key distinction is intent: the former’s prickliness stems from protectiveness of something sacred (authentic artistic expression) (do not throw pearls to swine), whereas the latter’s schmoozing stems from ambition within a social hierarchy. The techno purist’s aloof stance, while off-putting, is usually a reaction to what they perceive as pervasive inauthenticity in mainstream or art-oriented spaces. In a way, their elitism is a defensive posture to guard the “love” they have for their art form. This posture, however, carries its own irony: in guarding authenticity so fiercely, they risk creating a new kind of performance – a performance of purity and resistance. Still, when comparing the two poles, the noise/techno approach provides a genuine refuge for those weary of superficiality. Its very exclusivity is a byproduct of participants earnestly prioritizing music over everything else.

## Art Gangs versus Punk Reality: The Cologne Example

The tension between social performance and authenticity in Chicago’s underground is not a new cultural phenomenon. A revealing historical parallel comes from the late 1970s and early 1980s in West Berlin and Cologne, centered around artist Martin Kippenberger. Kippenberger’s story vividly illustrates how an art-scene “gang” built on performative social life can collide with a subculture rooted in authenticity and anti-pretension.

As mentioned, Kippenberger was a magnetic figure in the Cologne art world – a ringleader among the city’s young artists. He cultivated a circle of friends and collaborators that functioned much like an exclusive club. Accounts from that era describe how Kippenberger & Co. dominated the cultural nightlife, enacting a continuous performance of art and revelry. However, Kippenberger’s ambitions didn’t stop at traditional art venues; he attempted to straddle the line between the art scene and the burgeoning punk music scene of the time. In 1978, in Berlin’s Kreuzberg district, Kippenberger became the manager (and partial owner) of the punk club SO36, aiming to merge his art-world sensibilities with the raw energy of punk. This move can be seen as the act of a transactional artist inserting himself into a counterculture – perhaps an effort to harness punk’s authenticity for his own creative experiment, or simply a business venture to capitalize on a trendy scene.

The outcome was a legendary clash that has since become art lore. Kippenberger’s management of SO36 quickly ran afoul of the local punk ethos. True to his art-gang style, he imposed changes that reflected a more commercial mindset – notably raising the price of entry tickets and beer at the club (Texts by Wolfgang Müller). For the hardcore punk regulars of SO36, this was heresy: it signaled that their space was being gentrified by an art-school interloper more interested in profit and cachet than in the punk principle of authentic, accessible rebellion. The response was swift and pointed. A group of enraged punks, epitomized by a young woman nicknamed “Jenny the Rat,” physically confronted Kippenberger over his actions (The Paris Review - Susanne Kippenberger on ‘Kippenberger’ - The Paris Review). In the ensuing incident, Jenny – a teenager famous for sporting a pet white rat dyed pink on her shoulder – “demolished his face,” beating Kippenberger severely (Texts by Wolfgang Müller). The confrontation turned into a full-blown brawl between the punk autonomists and the art-club crowd at SO36, as a newspaper at the time recounted. Kippenberger, the cosmopolitan art provocateur, was literally beaten down by the street-level demand for authenticity.

Rather than retreat in shame, Kippenberger characteristically transformed the experience into art. He had a photograph taken of his bruised and bandaged face and later presented it as a self-portrait titled “Dialog mit der Jugend” – Dialogue with the Youth of Today (Texts by Wolfgang Müller). The piece immortalized the incident: the artist as a punched-out figure, attempting a “dialogue” with youth culture and paying the physical price for his perceived performative excesses. As Kippenberger’s sister Susanne later noted, “He took a photograph of himself after he was badly beaten by Berlin punks and called it Dialogue with the Youth of Today” (The Paris Review - Susanne Kippenberger on ‘Kippenberger’ - The Paris Review). The title itself carries ironic humor and a hint of self-awareness – a tacit acknowledgement that his encounter with the real youth (the punk subculture) was indeed a violent dialogue. Kippenberger left Berlin for Paris soon after (perhaps wisely seeking a scene where art and life didn’t “collide so heavily” (Texts by Wolfgang Müller)), but the story became part of his mythos.

This anecdote encapsulates the tensions between authenticity and social performance in any underground culture. Kippenberger’s Cologne gang embodied the performative, socially-driven art scene: talented, but also notorious for heavy partying, self-promotion, and blurring of life into art-as-spectacle. Jenny the Rat and her punk peers embodied the opposite: a subculture that valued anti-commercialism, honesty, and a DIY ethic, ready to literally fight those who violated its code. The fact that punks beat up a notable artist for “lavish” spending and club ownership sends a clear message – authenticity was non-negotiable in their community, and performative interlopers would be called out (or knocked out) for transgressing it.

Importantly, the Cologne/Berlin episode demonstrates that even within one individual (Kippenberger), these two poles can be in conflict: he sought authentic connection with the zeitgeist of youth, yet his ingrained habits of social performance and excess led to his undoing in that context. The Dialogue with the Youth became a one-sided lecture delivered via fists. For today’s observer, the lesson is instructive. Underground art scenes that behave like cliques or “gangs” may flourish socially, but they risk ring-fencing themselves away from raw authenticity. Conversely, purist subcultures (like punk, or by extension Chicago’s noise/techno scene) might appear aggressive or unwelcoming, but they serve as correctives that puncture the pretensions of more performative scenes. The push-and-pull between these forces drives cultural evolution: the art world seeks the vitality of the authentic underground, and the underground reacts against the co-option by the art world.

## Go Where the Love Is

The dichotomy between Chicago’s transactional art scenesters and its noise/techno purists ultimately illuminates a core principle for anyone navigating an underground culture: one must go where the love is. By “love,” we mean genuine passion, honesty, and mutual respect – the authentic core of why we engage in art or music in the first place. After examining both poles, it becomes clear that communities built on authentic enthusiasm and a strong sense of self offer deeper sustenance than those built on social maneuvering and fragile prestige. In practical terms, this means gravitating toward the shows, scenes, and people that prioritize the creative content (the music, the art) over the social context. It means, for instance, attending a warehouse noise show for the transcendent sonic experience, rather than going to a gallery opening just to mingle and be seen.

In Chicago, this ethos distinguishes certain subcultures sharply. Many in the art world attend exhibition openings or performances primarily to support friends and bolster social ties – it’s a scene of seeing and being seen. Meanwhile, the noise and techno crowds gather in dark clubs or DIY spaces for the music itself, often barely talking while a set is underway except to appreciatively nod to a particular beat drop or noise crescendo. The former may ask “Who’s going (and will I fit in)?,” whereas the latter asks “Who’s playing (and do I love their work)?”. These differing motivations mark the divide between a performative scene and an authentic community. Crucially, the enjoyment and fulfillment one derives from these experiences tend to be greater when one’s motivations align with sincere interest rather than social obligation. Going to a show for the music – losing oneself in a techno rhythm or a wall of noise – can be a liberating, affirmative experience. By contrast, going to an event chiefly out of duty to friends or for social credit can feel hollow, even draining, when the novelty wears off.

Embracing authenticity does not imply that the noise/techno subcultures are perfect utopias. We have acknowledged that these communities have their insufferable dynamics: snobbery, gatekeeping, and an irony that even in rejecting performance, they perform a kind of outsider elitism. However, these flaws tend to be byproducts of intense passion – a far more forgivable sin than the calculated self-interest that sometimes pervades art-world networking. A fragile, performative sense of identity built on social capital can crumble the moment the spotlight moves elsewhere; it is, by definition, dependent on others’ validation. In contrast, the identity one forges in a passionate subculture – as a dedicated noise artist or an obsessive techno DJ, for example – is more self-reliant and resilient. It comes from countless private hours of practice, listening, and learning, not just public hours of socializing. Thus, when the art world at large encounters these experimental music subcultures, it can feel unsettling. The usual tricks of social jockeying do not carry much weight in a crowd that values cred earned through authenticity. The art scene habitues, whose sense of self may rest on being known in the right circles, suddenly face a space where that currency is invalid. This can expose how “contingent” and performative their identity is, when stripped of its familiar context. In a very real way, the existence of a vibrant, self-sufficient music underground challenges the art world to confront its own values. It is as if the punk spirit that knocked Kippenberger down is always lurking, ready to knock the art world off its pedestal if it strays too far from sincerity.

The underground thrives when authenticity and love for the art form lead, even if accompanied by rough edges, rather than when social strategy dominates. Chicago’s cultural ecosystem, like many others, contains both approaches in uneasy harmony. But the most enduring contributions – the moments that people remember as truly life-changing or inspirational – tend to emerge from the authentic side: the all-night jam session that forged real bonds, the obscure zine or noise tape traded out of genuine enthusiasm, the dance floor where strangers communed purely through music. These are products of love, not leverage. Therefore, while we can acknowledge the transactional art scene’s realities and even its occasional utility (after all, networking can help resources flow), we ultimately argue in favor of the ethos embodied by the noise/techno purists. Their stance, for all its prickliness, reminds us that art and music are meant to be felt deeply, not just used as social ladders.

One must go where the love is – toward those pockets of community where people are comfortable being themselves, unfiltered, and where they engage with art out of passion rather than performance. By seeking out such communities, we align ourselves with a more sincere and sustaining cultural practice. In Chicago, that might mean slipping into a sweaty basement show or a late-night techno party where no one cares who you are, only how you experience the sound. It means valuing the authentic connections forged in shared artistic passion over the fickle affirmations of a scene. Ultimately, the reward for favoring authenticity is a richer sense of belonging and self. In a world full of performances, choosing the real – however noisy, gritty, or aloof it may sometimes be – is a radical act of love for art and for oneself. (Texts by Wolfgang Müller)
